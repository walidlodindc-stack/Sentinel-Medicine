# Sentinel-Medicine

## About

Sentinel-Medicine is a collection of hypothesis-driven medical write-ups.

The focus is on **susceptible nervous systems** and other edge-case physiology:
how a small subset of people react very differently to “normal” doses, drugs,
foods, or environmental inputs – and how those patterns often slip past
standard trials, guidelines, and population averages.

Each piece typically includes:

- **Clinical signal** – recurring patterns seen in real patients or in personal N=1 cases  
- **Mechanistic sketch** – plausible pathways that could explain the pattern  
- **Literature bridge** – how existing data supports or conflicts with the hypothesis  
- **Proposed study design** – what a serious test of the idea would look like  
- **Practical probe** – cautious N=1 or clinical experiments to explore the effect

The goal is not to declare new truths, but to surface **sentinel hypotheses**  
that deserve proper research – especially where current tools, dose assumptions,
or study designs are calibrated to “average” brains and bodies.
