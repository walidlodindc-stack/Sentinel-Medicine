# Coke, Diet Coke, and Susceptible Brains  
*A hypothesis about legal micro-stimulants, trace coca alkaloids, and high-gain nervous systems*

**Disclaimer: This is a hypothesis paper, not medical advice.**  
It does not claim that Coca-Cola is breaking the law.  
It does not claim that standard formulations are unsafe for the general population.  

It argues that for a subset of highly susceptible individuals, Coke/Diet Coke may function as mild, legal micro-stimulants — and that trace coca-derived components should be treated as a prime mechanistic suspect **until rigorously exonerated**.

## Introduction: When “Just a Soda” Isn’t Just a Soda

Most people can drink Coke or Diet Coke without thinking twice. It’s a treat, a habit, a brand they grew up with. For them, it’s background noise in the nervous system.

But there is another group—often misdiagnosed, dismissed, or confused by their own reactions—for whom Coke and Diet Coke do not behave like neutral beverages. A small glass can be followed by a surge of anxiety the next day. A single bottle can flip sleep from “fine” to “wired until 3 a.m.” They can drink coffee, other sodas, or energy drinks without the same crash, yet Coke or Diet Coke keep showing up as a reliable trigger.

At the same time, these same people often find they:

- Crave Coke/Diet Coke specifically  
- Struggle to stop despite repeated attempts, and  
- Use it—consciously or not—as a way to control their state: to focus, to calm, to push through fatigue, or to feel “normal.”

The culture calls this “just soda.” The marketing calls it “a feeling.” But for a subset of susceptible nervous systems, what’s happening looks closer to a mild, legal micro-stimulant relationship than a simple beverage choice.

This paper makes a modest but important claim:

- For most people, Coke and Diet Coke are harmless in the way we usually assume.  
- For a vulnerable minority, that assumption may be wrong.  

Our current tools, dose assumptions, and study designs are calibrated on average brains, not on highly sensitized or pharmacogenetically unusual ones.

The goal here is not to prove that Coca-Cola is secretly dosing the world with cocaine, nor to argue that everyone should stop drinking soda. The goals are to:

- Define what “susceptible” might actually mean at a nervous-system level.  
- Propose a plausible mechanism for why Coke/Diet Coke could act as state-altering micro-stimulants in that subset—potentially including contributions from coca-derived flavour components or trace alkaloids in decocainized extracts (a speculative but testable mechanism).  
- Show how existing sensitization science quietly supports this possibility.  
- Outline a concrete study that could test the hypothesis properly.

## Core thesis

For a vulnerable subset of susceptible individuals, Coke and Diet Coke function less like neutral beverages and more like **mild, legal micro-stimulants**—helping explain why some athletes swear by them and why some people cannot quit despite repeated attempts.

For this group, the working model in this paper is blunt:

- Caffeine + sugar/sweetener + a high-gain nervous system may not fully explain the effect.  
- In this paper’s mechanistic model, **trace coca-derived alkaloids are treated as the prime suspect**—not in the sense of a proven cause, but because, given their uniqueness to Coke/Diet Coke and their historical psychoactive context, they should be the **first mechanistic candidate rigorously tested and either cleared or confirmed**, rather than being assumed irrelevant by default.

---

## Susceptible Nervous Systems: Who Is at Risk?

In this context, “susceptible individuals” are people whose nervous systems respond more strongly and more persistently to psychoactive inputs than average. This often includes those with:

- Chronic anxiety or hyperarousal  
- ADHD or trauma histories  
- Heightened sensitivity to medications or recreational drugs  
- A pattern of experiencing outsized effects from relatively small doses  

These are the people who feel:

- Half a tablet when others need two  
- One espresso like a triple shot  
- A tiny dose change in psychiatric meds that barely moves the lab values  

For them, “trace,” “sub-clinical,” and “negligible” don’t always behave the way pharmacology textbooks say they should.

---

## Hypothesis

In a subset of susceptible individuals with highly reactive nervous systems, chronic consumption of Coke or Diet Coke acts as a mild state-altering agent—a legal micro-stimulant—via a combination of:

- Caffeine  
- Sugar or artificial sweeteners  
- And possibly contributions from coca-derived flavour components or trace alkaloids in decocainized extracts  

(Again: speculative, but testable with the right chemistry and the right cohort.)

This may manifest as:

- Reproducible changes in anxiety, sleep, and baseline arousal  
- Strong, semi-compulsive craving and difficulty quitting  
- A marked preference for Coke/Diet Coke over other sodas or caffeinated drinks, despite similar nominal caffeine or sugar content

## 1. Individual Variability & Susceptible Brains

### 1.1 Why Some Brains Are “Too Sensitive” to Ignore

Even among people with similar diagnoses (anxiety, ADHD, trauma), not all brains respond to psychoactive inputs in the same way. Some can drink multiple coffees or colas with little subjective change. Others—the “susceptible individuals” discussed here—experience outsized effects from what appear to be modest or even trivial doses.

There are several layers to this variability.

### 1.2 Pharmacogenomics (genetic metabolism and clearance)

Some people carry variants in liver enzymes (such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) that alter how quickly they metabolize caffeine, psychiatric medications, or other compounds.

- “Slow metabolizers” can experience higher and longer-lasting effective exposure from the same dose.  
- A standard amount of caffeine or stimulant can feel like a double dose if their clearance is delayed.

### 1.3 Neuromodulator breakdown (COMT, MAO and dopamine/noradrenaline tone)

Genes such as COMT and MAO help break down dopamine, noradrenaline, and related neurotransmitters. Variants that reduce their activity can lead to:

- Higher synaptic levels of dopamine/noradrenaline  
- Exaggerated responses to anything that nudges these systems  

In practical terms:

- A small stimulant hit feels bigger  
- “Trace” stimulation may be enough to change state  
- The nervous system may learn to rely on these micro-pushes to feel “normal”  

This matches the lived description many susceptible people give: an **“insane affinity to trace amounts,”** where tiny exposures that would be irrelevant to most people reliably change how they feel.

### 1.4 Sensitization: prior exposure lowers the bar for what counts as an effect

Sensitization is the process by which repeated exposure to a drug or stimulus makes the system respond more strongly over time, even to smaller doses.

Animal studies show:

- Doses that are “sub-threshold” (too small to cause reward or obvious behavioural change in naïve animals) can start to produce reward-seeking behavior after the system has been sensitized.  
- Prior exposure in adolescence can make adult animals more reactive to later low doses, with changes in signalling pathways (e.g., CaMKII, DUSP1) and “feel off” stress phenotypes.  
- Stress and trauma models increase sensitivity to low-dose stimulants, amplifying responses that were previously negligible.

We do not yet have equivalent ultra-low-dose data in sensitized humans, especially not at the level of everyday products like cola. But the animal work clearly shows one thing:

**Thresholds are not fixed.**  

Once a brain has been sensitized, the dose at which “nothing happens” in a naïve system may very much be “something” in a high-gain one.

For susceptible individuals drinking 1–2 L/day of Coke or Diet Coke, with ADHD, trauma or prior stimulant exposure in the background, it is therefore entirely plausible that what looks like a “harmless beverage dose” to the average person is functioning as a meaningful state-control input for them.

---

## 2. The Voltmeter on the Wrong Setting

This is where the “voltmeter on the wrong setting” analogy becomes important.

Most of our toxicology, pharmacology, and safety assumptions are calibrated on average, naïve systems—people without major sensitization, without extreme pharmacogenomic quirks, and without nervous systems reshaped by chronic stress or trauma. In that population, you set the meter to the **“10-amp” range**:

- You only see large, obvious effects at moderate to high doses, and  
- Anything below that is recorded as “nothing happens.”

But susceptible individuals are not running that hardware. They are sensitized, pharmacogenetically unusual, or trauma-primed nervous systems operating more like **high-gain amplifiers**. For them, the same input can land very differently:

- A dose that is sub-threshold and invisible on the “10-amp” setting may be clearly detectable—physiologically and subjectively—if you switch the meter down to the **milliamp range**.

When we say “trace,” “sub-clinical,” or “negligible” based on data from average subjects and coarse tools, we are not actually proving there is no effect in susceptible brains; we are only proving that:

> We have not looked at the right sensitivity, in the right population, with the right questions.

This is the crux of the methodological critique:  
**Regulatory voltmeters are pointed at the wrong nervous systems.**

---

## 3. The Nicotine-in-the-Water Analogy  
### How Trace Can Still Matter for Certain Brains

A useful way to visualize this:

- Take someone with a strong nicotine dependence.  
- Put a tiny amount of nicotine—well below usual “active dose” thresholds—into a glass of water.  

For a non-smoker, that’s functionally nothing.  

For a heavily dependent smoker who is in withdrawal, that same trace amount may shift craving, mood, or body sensation in ways they can detect.

From the outside, the dose looks “too small to matter.”  
From inside a sensitized, receptor-hungry system, it absolutely matters.

This is the analogy for trace coca-derived alkaloids in Coke/Diet Coke for a sensitized subset:

- To the average brain: noise.  
- To a dopamine-starved, ADHD, anxious, or trauma-primed system that has been pairing this drink with state improvement for years:  
  - One more micro-signal in the direction of “this fixes me.”  
  - One more drop in the glass that the voltmeter can’t see but the nervous system can.

The key point:

> “Trace” does not mean “zero effect” in a brain that is primed to hear whispers.

## 4. Mechanism: Why Coke Might Hit Differently  
### Beyond “just caffeine and sugar”

There are many reasons Coke/Diet Coke might feel different from other caffeinated drinks:

- Caffeine dose and timing  
- Sugar vs artificial sweetener dynamics  
- Carbonation and gastric absorption  
- Brand conditioning and ritual  

All of these matter. But the critical observation is:

> When you hold most of those constant across other drinks, many susceptible people still report that Coke/Diet Coke “hit different” — physiologically and psychologically.

The working mechanistic picture for susceptible brains:

**Baseline: a nervous system with:**

- ADHD, anxiety, trauma, or stress history  
- Possible CYP/COMT/MAO variants  
- Prior stimulant exposures and sensitization  

**Input: a beverage that combines:**

- Caffeine (stimulant)  
- Sugar or artificial sweeteners (metabolic and reward signalling)  
- Carbonation (modulates absorption)  
- Coca-derived flavour components from decocainized extracts, potentially including trace non-cocaine alkaloids and other bioactives  

**Result in susceptible brains:**

- Small but reliable changes in dopamine/noradrenaline tone  
- Repeated pairing of “I drink this” with “I can finally focus / feel normal / calm my chaos”  
- Gradual consolidation into a micro-stimulant dependency loop  

The claim is **not**:

> “Coke has enough cocaine to be a secret illegal stimulant.”

The claim is:

> For a small but important subset of nervous systems, Coke/Diet Coke behave as if they were micro-stimulants. Given the unique coca-derived flavour source, trace alkaloids should be treated as the **leading mechanistic candidate to test first**, until exonerated by data.

### 4.1 Competing mechanisms and why coca stays central

Several non–cola-specific mechanisms could plausibly account for much of the effect in susceptible individuals:

- Caffeine pharmacogenetics (slow vs fast metabolizers)  
- Sugar vs artificial sweeteners and their metabolic and reward effects  
- Carbonation and gastric absorption kinetics  
- Conditioning, ritual, and brand association over years  

All of these likely contribute. However, they are **not unique to Coke/Diet Coke**: many coffees, colas, and energy drinks share similar caffeine loads, sweetener profiles, and carbonation yet do **not** reliably produce the same pattern of Coke-specific craving, next-day anxiety, and “this drink hits different” reports in susceptible people.

That asymmetry is why this paper treats **coca-derived flavour components** as the leading mechanistic candidate to test first: they are the one major ingredient that is both *biologically interesting* and *unique* to the products that generate this clinical pattern.

## 5. A Recalibration Study for Sub-Threshold Effects in Susceptible Individuals

If the core problem is that existing studies are using the wrong “meter range” for the wrong population, then the solution is conceptually simple:

> Recalibrate the instruments and pick the right people.

Here is a sketch of the kind of study that could meaningfully test the hypothesis that Coke/Diet Coke act as micro-stimulants in susceptible individuals — and whether coca-derived components matter.

### 5.1 Cohort Design

**Susceptible group – individuals with:**

- Chronic anxiety or hyperarousal  
- ADHD or trauma histories  
- Clear self-reported sensitivity to stimulants or medications  
- Strong, semi-compulsive use of Coke/Diet Coke  
  - e.g., 1–2 L/day, difficulty quitting, emotional resistance to stopping  

Optional stratification by:

- Prior cocaine or stimulant use  
- Pharmacogenomic profile (CYP, COMT, MAO variants)  

**Control group – individuals with:**

- No significant anxiety/ADHD/trauma  
- Average responses to caffeine/medications  
- Moderate or minimal cola use  

### 5.2 Interventions (blinded, crossover)

Under randomized, blinded conditions, participants receive on different days:

- Coke or Diet Coke (standardized volume)  
- A caffeine/sugar-matched non-Coke cola (no coca-derived flavouring)  
- A caffeine-matched non-cola beverage  
- Possibly a caffeine-free cola-flavoured control  

Drinks can be partially diluted or given in opaque containers to reduce brand and visual cueing, while still preserving flavour/aroma.

If formulations with and without coca-derived flavouring can be obtained under controlled conditions, **that arm would be the critical mechanistic test.**

### 5.3 Measures

Instead of only looking for big “drug effects,” the study would focus on **milliamp-level changes.**

**Subjective state**

- Anxiety ratings (e.g., 0–10)  
- Restlessness, “wired/tired” feelings  
- Craving or urge to drink more  

**Physiological**

- Heart rate and HRV (heart rate variability)  
- Sleep latency and quality that night  
- Simple reaction-time or working-memory tasks  

**Behavioural**

- Choice tests (which drink they prefer when blinded)  
- Willingness to delay or skip the next cola serving  
- Self-reported “need” for the drink  

### 5.4 Key Questions

The key question is not whether Coke behaves like a large dose of cocaine.

The key questions are:

- In susceptible individuals, do Coke/Diet Coke consistently produce measurably different state shifts, cravings, or preferences compared to other caffeine/sugar-matched beverages—even when branding and appearance are controlled?  

If a coca-flavour-free formulation can be tested:

- Does removing coca-derived flavour components reduce:
  - Craving  
  - State shift magnitude  
  - “Need this specific drink” behaviour  
  relative to standard Coke/Diet Coke?

If such differences reliably appear in the susceptible group but not in controls, that would support the idea that:

- Our current “trace = negligible” assumptions are too coarse for some nervous systems, and  
- Coke/Diet Coke are quietly acting as legal micro-stimulants for a small but important subset of people, with coca-derived components as a leading candidate mechanism.

This would not prove that trace cocaine itself is the main driver. It would, however, justify much deeper investigation into:

- Cola-specific flavour matrices (including decocainized coca extracts and any residual trace alkaloids)  
- Pharmacogenomic profiles of susceptible individuals  
- Long-term mental health outcomes in chronic high-volume cola users  

---

## 6. What Existing Data Suggests About Sub-Threshold Doses and Sensitization

Existing animal and human data, while not designed for cola-level exposures, already show the basic shape of the problem.

**Repeated low doses can flip a system into hypersensitivity.**  
In rats, even sub-threshold cocaine doses (too small to cause reward or obvious behavioural change in naïve animals) can trigger conditioned place preference (CPP—a reward-seeking behaviour) after sensitization.

**Early exposure increases later sensitivity.**  
Adolescent cocaine exposure makes adult animals more sensitive to later low doses, activating more CaMKII-positive neurons and inducing “feel off” phenotypes such as reduced DUSP1, a stress-regulating factor.

**Sensitization shifts dopamine signalling thresholds.**  
Chronic cocaine can dampen baseline dopamine during intoxication but make the system more reactive to low doses over time. In both humans and animals, repeated use increases sensitivity to toxic effects (anxiety, paranoia) at lower doses than were initially required.

**Hypersensitive models show dramatic changes after repetition.**  
Low-PPI mouse models (used as a proxy for sensory/gating hypersensitivity) may show low initial sensitivity to cocaine but massive increases after repeated exposure.

**Binding studies are calibrated for big doses, not traces.**  
Dopamine transporter (DAT) occupancy studies typically examine mg-scale doses, with measurable effects starting at tens of milligrams. Yet sensitization studies show that sub-threshold doses in the 0.7–5 mg/kg range can elicit locomotion or reward after priming. We have essentially no nano/microgram-level data in sensitized humans.

Taken together, these findings suggest a consistent pattern:

- Sensitization enhances sub-threshold activity in dopamine pathways  
- Low doses can calm or normalize in some contexts and trigger anxiety in others, depending on prior history and state  
- Stress and trauma increase sensitization to low-dose stimulants  

In other words:

> In wired, sensitized, or susceptible systems, the “wrong setting on the voltmeter” really does hide real signals. The absence of evidence at coarse resolution and in average populations is not evidence of absence for people whose nervous systems are running in milliamp mode.

## 7. Branding the Feeling: When the Market Message Matches the Mechanism

Coca-Cola has never really sold “a cola.” For decades, its advertising has focused not on ingredients, but on **state**:

- “It’s the real thing.”  
- “You can’t beat the feeling.”  
- “Taste the feeling.”  
- “Things go better with Coke.”  

These are not descriptions of a flavour profile. They are direct appeals to how Coke makes you feel—positioning the drink as a reliable state-change tool. For most consumers, this is just clever branding. For susceptible individuals, it can feel uncomfortably literal.

If Coke and Diet Coke act as mild, legal micro-stimulants in a subset of people with highly reactive nervous systems, then the slogans are doing double duty:

- On the surface, they sell a lifestyle and an emotion.  
- At a deeper level, they resonate with the lived reality of people who really do experience Coke as something you “can’t beat the feeling” of, and who reach for it to make “things go better.”

From the inside of a susceptible nervous system, the brand message can feel less like advertising and more like recognition:

> “Here is the thing that fixes your state. Here is the thing you rely on.”

It is important to be precise:

- We do not have evidence that Coca-Cola is intentionally formulating for micro-stimulant effects in susceptible individuals or knowingly exploiting trace alkaloids in that way.

What we do have is an uncanny alignment between:

- A product that, for some people, functions as a subtle psychoactive (potentially including contributions from trace coca alkaloids in decocainized flavour extracts), and  
- A decades-long marketing strategy built around feelings, performance, and life going “better with Coke.”

For a subset of susceptible brains, that combination can turn a branded beverage into a socially invisible dependence loop:

- The culture calls it “just soda.”  
- The ads call it a feeling.  
- The nervous system quietly treats it as a drug.

From their perspective, the advertising doesn’t just sell Coke—it almost feels like it’s **winking at them** about what it actually does.

---

## 8. Clinical Signal: How This Shows Up in Real Life

Clinically and anecdotally, a recognizable pattern keeps appearing around Coke and Diet Coke in susceptible individuals. These are not people who “just like soda.” They often report that:

- They can drink other sodas, coffee, or energy drinks without the same psychological fallout,  
- Yet Coke or Diet Coke consistently hit different—in how they feel, how they crave, and how hard it is to stop.

Common features include:

- **Next-day anxiety or mood shifts** that correlate specifically with Coke/Diet Coke, not with other caffeine or sugar sources. People describe going from a relatively calm day (e.g., anxiety 2–3/10) to a sudden spike (8–10/10) the following day after what they considered “a small amount” of Coke—usually without realizing the connection for years.  
- **Heavy, entrenched use patterns**, such as drinking Coke or Diet Coke as the primary daily fluid (multiple cans or bottles per day) while barely touching water or other beverages, often maintained for years.  
- **Difficulty quitting that feels disproportionate to “just a drink”**: repeated failed attempts to cut down, strong pushback when abstinence is suggested, and a noticeable emotional reaction to the idea of stopping—even in people who freely admit it may be bad for their health or anxiety.  
- **Use of Coke/Diet Coke as a performance or state-control tool**—to focus, to push through fatigue, to stabilize mood before tasks, or in athletic contexts where other equally caffeinated options are available but not perceived as equivalent.  
- In some cases, a **history of stimulant or cocaine use**, with Coke or Diet Coke becoming the “acceptable,” legal, socially invisible substitute once illegal drugs are stopped—while the relationship to the drink looks more like dependence than preference.  
- **Changes in subjective taste or body sensation** (e.g., suddenly finding Diet Coke “disgustingly sweet,” feeling tingling in the lips when chugging Coke, or describing it as “too intense”), yet continued consumption despite this aversion, which is more consistent with a dependency loop than simple hedonic enjoyment.

Some susceptible individuals also describe Coke or Diet Coke as their **“study fuel”** long before they ever touch formal ADHD medication. They report that these drinks help them lock in and focus in a way coffee never did—cramming months of material into a single night and actually retaining it. In retrospect, this pattern looks less like coincidence and more like a genuine micro-stimulant effect in ADHD brains, where the specific combination of caffeine, sugar or sweetener, and possibly trace coca-derived alkaloids nudges dopamine and noradrenaline just enough to temporarily normalize focus.

This lines up with a widely shared, half-joking clinical observation:

> Many psychiatrists say they can “spot undiagnosed ADHD by how many Diet Cokes or chocolate stashes a patient has.”

Behind the joke is a consistent picture—under-treated or unrecognized ADHD patients, often women, self-medicating with Diet Coke, cola and chocolate as improvised, legal stimulant patches. From the framework in this paper, that isn’t random:

> It is exactly what you would expect if susceptible, dopamine-hungry nervous systems are unconsciously gravitating toward Coke/Diet Coke as accessible micro-stimulants, with trace coca-derived components acting as one more tiny push on an already high-gain system.

These patterns are not universal, and many people drink Coke or Diet Coke without any obvious problem. But in susceptible individuals—those with highly reactive nervous systems, anxiety/ADHD/trauma histories, or prior stimulant exposure—the combination of:

- Specific brand craving  
- Reproducible state changes  
- Resistance to stopping despite insight  

looks less like a casual beverage habit and more like a **mild, legal micro-stimulant relationship hiding in plain sight.**

It is this subset, not the general population, that this paper is concerned with.

## 9. What Would Actually Settle This?

If Coca-Cola and regulators want to definitively clear decocainized coca components, the path is straightforward:

- **Independent chemical analysis** of decocainized coca flavour extracts, looking not just for cocaine, but for all detectable alkaloids and bioactive candidates, at **realistic beverage concentrations**.  
- **Blinded crossover studies** in susceptible vs control individuals, comparing:
  - Standard Coke/Diet Coke  
  - Formulations identical except for the absence of coca-derived flavouring  
  - Caffeine/sugar-matched non-coke colas  

With **milliamp-sensitivity outcome measures**:

- Anxiety, sleep, craving, working memory, willingness-to-work for the drink, choice behaviour under blind conditions.

If:

- Coke/Diet Coke do **not** differ from non-coca colas in susceptible individuals under those conditions, and  
- Decocainized extracts show **no plausible psychoactive candidates** at physiologically relevant levels,

then the trace-alkaloid hypothesis will have been falsified or downgraded. The story would likely shift toward “caffeine + sweetener + conditioning + absorption kinetics” doing most of the work.

Until such data exist, however, the current situation is:

- A globally consumed product with a unique coca-derived flavour source,  
- Minimal study at milliamp sensitivity in the right population, and  
- A clinically recognizable subset whose brains treat it like a drug.

From a safety and scientific standpoint, that is enough to warrant **serious, focused investigation.**

---

## 9.5 Limitations

This is a hypothesis-generating paper. Several limitations are important to state explicitly:

- There is currently **no published, independent alkaloid profiling** of decocainized coca extracts at realistic beverage concentrations.  
- Sensitization and sub-threshold dose arguments are drawn largely from animal and indirect human data and extrapolated to everyday products.  
- The clinical patterns described here are based on observation and self-report, not on a formal cohort study with controls.  
- Alternative explanations—caffeine pharmacogenetics, sweeteners, carbonation, and conditioning—may fully explain the observed effects; the trace alkaloid hypothesis is a **prioritized mechanism to test**, not a concluded fact.

These limitations do not make the question trivial; they are precisely why targeted chemistry and well-designed human studies are needed.

---

## 10. Not “Ban Coke,” But Map Its Territory

It is important to be clear about what this paper is **not** saying.

It is not arguing that Coca-Cola should be banned, nor that trace coca alkaloids (if present at ultra-low levels in decocainized extracts) are inherently unacceptable in a beverage. In fact, it is entirely possible that:

- For many people, Coke and Diet Coke remain harmless background beverages.  
- For a subset of susceptible individuals, they are net harmful at their current dose and frequency, primarily through anxiety, sleep disruption, and quiet dependence.  
- For another subset, there may be a real, functional benefit—for example, ADHD-pattern brains that find Coke/Diet Coke more helpful than formal medication, or prefer it because it feels gentler, familiar, and controllable.

The problem is not that a common beverage can have psychoactive effects.  
**The problem is that:**

- Those effects are not openly framed as such,  
- The most vulnerable users are never told they are in a risk band, and  
- The potential “therapeutic” lane is completely unmapped and unguardrailed.

In that sense, the situation is closer to **nicotine in very low doses**:

- A tiny nicotine micro-dose in water may do nothing for most people.  
- The same trace dose in a heavily nicotine-sensitized, craving smoker can genuinely change their state.  

From the outside, the dose looks “too small to matter.”  
From the inside of the right nervous system, **it is enough**.

Coke and Diet Coke may be occupying a similar space for susceptible brains:

- At 1–2 L/day, over years, with ADHD/trauma/anxiety in the background, even trace psychoactive contributions from coca-derived flavour components could matter—especially layered on top of caffeine, sugar/sweetener, and conditioning.  
- For some, that may mean overstimulation and anxiety.  
- For others, it may mean a preferred, familiar micro-stimulant they consciously or unconsciously choose instead of formal medication.

If future studies confirm that:

- Coke/Diet Coke act as micro-stimulants in a defined subset of sensitive users, and  
- Trace coca alkaloids or other cola-specific components contribute to that effect,

then the logical next step is not moral panic, but **clear definition of the lane**:

- Transparent communication that **“for some brains, this is not neutral — it’s a psychoactive tool.”**  
- Practical guidance on safe upper bounds for high-risk groups (e.g., chronic anxiety, insomnia, ADHD on stimulants, trauma histories).  
- Exploration—carefully and ethically—of whether there is a legitimate, safer therapeutic window where cola-like formulations could be used intentionally rather than accidentally, instead of people discovering it haphazardly in supermarket bottles.

In other words: the goal is not to declare Coke “bad,” but to stop pretending it is the same thing for every nervous system.

- For robust, average brains, it may stay what it has always been: a sweet, caffeinated drink.  
- For susceptible brains, it may need to be treated—and labeled—as what it already functions as in real life: **a mild, legal micro-stimulant whose dose, frequency, and context matter.**
