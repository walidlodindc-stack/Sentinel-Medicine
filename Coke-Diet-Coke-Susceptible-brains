## When “Just a Soda” Isn’t Just a Soda

Most people can drink Coke or Diet Coke without thinking twice. It’s a treat, a habit, a brand they grew up with. For them, it’s background noise in the nervous system.

But there is another group—often misdiagnosed, dismissed, or confused by their own reactions—for whom Coke and Diet Coke do not behave like neutral beverages. A small glass can be followed by a surge of anxiety the next day. A single bottle can flip sleep from “fine” to “wired until 3 a.m.” They can drink coffee, other sodas, or energy drinks without the same crash, yet Coke or Diet Coke keep showing up as a reliable trigger.

At the same time, these same people often find they:

- Crave Coke/Diet Coke specifically  
- Struggle to stop despite repeated attempts  
- Use it—consciously or not—as a way to control their state: to focus, to calm, to push through fatigue, or to feel “normal”

The culture calls this “just soda.” The marketing calls it “a feeling.” But for a subset of susceptible nervous systems, what’s happening looks closer to a mild, legal micro-stimulant relationship than a simple beverage choice.

This paper makes a modest but important claim:

- For most people, Coke and Diet Coke are harmless in the way we usually assume.  
- For a vulnerable minority, that assumption may be wrong.  
- Our current tools, dose assumptions, and study designs are calibrated on average brains, not on highly sensitized or pharmacogenetically unusual ones.

The goal here is not to prove that Coca-Cola is secretly dosing the world with cocaine, nor to argue that everyone should stop drinking soda. The goal is to:

- Define what “susceptible” might actually mean at a nervous-system level.  
- Propose a plausible mechanism for why Coke/Diet Coke could act as state-altering micro-stimulants in that subset.  
- Show how existing sensitization science quietly supports this possibility.  
- Outline a concrete study that could test the hypothesis properly.  

> **Core Thesis**  
> For a vulnerable subset of susceptible individuals, Coke and Diet Coke function less like neutral beverages and more like mild, legal micro-stimulants—helping explain why some athletes swear by them and why some people cannot quit despite repeated attempts.

## 1. Susceptible Nervous Systems: Who Is at Risk?

In this context, “susceptible individuals” are people whose nervous systems respond more strongly and more persistently to psychoactive inputs than average. This often includes those with:

- chronic anxiety or hyperarousal  
- ADHD or trauma histories  
- heightened sensitivity to medications or recreational drugs  
- a pattern of experiencing outsized effects from relatively small doses

### Hypothesis

In a subset of susceptible individuals with highly reactive nervous systems, chronic consumption of Coke or Diet Coke acts as a mild state-altering agent—a legal micro-stimulant—via a combination of caffeine, sugar or artificial sweeteners, and possibly contributions from coca-derived flavour components or trace alkaloids in decocainized extracts (a speculative but testable mechanism).

This may manifest as:

- reproducible changes in anxiety, sleep, and baseline arousal  
- strong, semi-compulsive craving and difficulty quitting  
- a marked preference for Coke/Diet Coke over other sodas or caffeinated drinks, despite similar nominal caffeine or sugar content

## 2. Individual Variability & Susceptible Brains

### 2.1 Why Some Brains Are “Too Sensitive” to Ignore

Even among people with similar diagnoses (anxiety, ADHD, trauma), not all brains respond to psychoactive inputs in the same way. Some can drink multiple coffees or colas with little subjective change. Others—the “susceptible individuals” discussed here—experience outsized effects from what appear to be modest or even trivial doses.

There are several layers to this variability.

### 2.2 Pharmacogenomics (genetic metabolism and clearance)

Some people carry variants in liver enzymes (such as CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) that alter how quickly they metabolize caffeine, psychiatric medications, or other compounds. “Slow metabolizers” can experience higher and longer-lasting effective exposure from the same dose. A standard amount of caffeine or stimulant can feel like a double dose if their clearance is delayed.

### 2.3 Neuromodulator breakdown (COMT, MAO and dopamine/noradrenaline tone)

Genes such as COMT and MAO help break down dopamine, noradrenaline, and related neurotransmitters. Variants that reduce their activity can lead to higher synaptic levels and exaggerated responses to anything that nudges these systems. In practical terms:

- a small stimulant hit feels bigger  
- “trace” stimulation may be enough to change state  
- the nervous system may learn to rely on these micro-pushes to feel “normal”

This matches the lived description many susceptible people give: an “insane affinity to trace amounts,” where tiny exposures that would be irrelevant to most people reliably change how they feel.

### 2.4 Sensitization: prior exposure lowers the bar for what counts as an effect

Sensitization is the process by which repeated exposure to a drug or stimulus makes the system respond more strongly over time, even to smaller doses. Animal studies show:

- Doses that are “sub-threshold” (too small to cause reward or obvious behavioural change in naïve animals) can start to produce reward-seeking behavior after the system has been sensitized.  
- Prior exposure in adolescence can make adult animals more reactive to later low doses, with changes in signalling pathways (e.g., CaMKII, DUSP1) and “feel off” stress phenotypes.  
- Stress and trauma models increase sensitivity to low-dose stimulants, amplifying responses that were previously negligible.

We do not yet have equivalent ultra-low-dose data in sensitized humans, especially not at the level of everyday products like cola. But the animal work clearly shows one thing: **thresholds are not fixed**. Once a brain has been sensitized, the dose at which “nothing happens” in a naïve system may very much be “something” in a high-gain one.

For susceptible individuals drinking 1–2 L/day of Coke or Diet Coke, with ADHD, trauma or prior stimulant exposure in the background, it is therefore entirely plausible that what looks like a “harmless beverage dose” to the average person is functioning as a meaningful state-control input for them.

## 3. The Voltmeter on the Wrong Setting

This is where the “voltmeter on the wrong setting” analogy becomes important.

Most of our toxicology, pharmacology, and safety assumptions are calibrated on average, naïve systems—people without major sensitization, without extreme pharmacogenomic quirks, and without nervous systems reshaped by chronic stress or trauma. In that population, you set the meter to the “10-amp” range: you only see large, obvious effects at moderate to high doses, and anything below that is recorded as “nothing happens.”

But susceptible individuals are not running that hardware. They are sensitized, pharmacogenetically unusual, or trauma-primed nervous systems operating more like high-gain amplifiers. For them, the same input can land very differently: a dose that is sub-threshold and invisible on the “10-amp” setting may be clearly detectable—physiologically and subjectively—if you switch the meter down to the milliamp range.

When we say “trace,” “sub-clinical,” or “negligible” based on data from average subjects and coarse tools, we are not actually proving there is no effect in susceptible brains; we are only proving that we have not looked at the right sensitivity, in the right population, with the right questions.

## 4. A Recalibration Study for Sub-Threshold Effects

If the core problem is that existing studies are using the wrong “meter range” for the wrong population, then the solution is conceptually simple: recalibrate the instruments and pick the right people.

Here is a sketch of the kind of study that could meaningfully test the hypothesis that Coke/Diet Coke act as micro-stimulants in susceptible individuals.

### 4.1 Cohort Design

**Susceptible group – individuals with:**

- chronic anxiety or hyperarousal  
- ADHD or trauma histories  
- clear self-reported sensitivity to stimulants or medications  
- strong, semi-compulsive use of Coke/Diet Coke (e.g., 1–2 L/day, difficulty quitting)

**Optional stratification by:**

- prior cocaine or stimulant use  
- pharmacogenomic profile (CYP, COMT, MAO variants)

**Control group – individuals with:**

- no significant anxiety/ADHD/trauma  
- average responses to caffeine/medications  
- moderate or minimal cola use  

### 4.2 Interventions (blinded, crossover)

Under randomized, blinded conditions, participants receive on different days:

- Coke or Diet Coke (standardized volume)  
- Pepsi or another caffeine/sugar-matched non-Coke cola  
- a caffeine-matched non-cola beverage  
- possibly a caffeine-free cola-flavoured control  

Drinks can be partially diluted or given in opaque containers to reduce brand and visual cueing, while still preserving flavour/aroma.

### 4.3 Measures

Instead of only looking for big “drug effects,” the study would focus on milliamp-level changes.

**Subjective state**

- anxiety ratings (e.g., 0–10)  
- restlessness, “wired/tired” feelings  
- craving or urge to drink more  

**Physiological**

- heart rate and HRV (heart rate variability)  
- sleep latency and quality that night  
- simple reaction-time or working memory tasks  

**Behavioural**

- choice tests (which drink they prefer when blinded)  
- willingness to delay or skip the next cola serving  
- self-reported “need” for the drink  

### 4.4 Interpretation

The key question is not whether Coke behaves like a large dose of cocaine. It is whether, in susceptible individuals, Coke/Diet Coke consistently produce measurably different state shifts, cravings, or preferences compared to other caffeine/sugar-matched beverages—even when branding and appearance are controlled.

If such differences reliably appear in the susceptible group but not in controls, that would support the idea that:

- our current “trace = negligible” assumptions are too coarse for some nervous systems, and  
- Coke/Diet Coke are quietly acting as legal micro-stimulants for a small but important subset of people.

This would not prove that trace cocaine itself is the main driver. It would, however, justify much deeper investigation into:

- cola-specific flavour matrices (including decocainized coca extracts)  
- pharmacogenomic profiles of susceptible individuals  
- long-term mental health outcomes in chronic high-volume cola users

## 5. What Existing Data Suggests About Sub-Threshold Doses

Existing animal and human data, while not designed for cola-level exposures, already show the basic shape of the problem.

- **Repeated low doses can flip a system into hypersensitivity.**  
  In rats, even sub-threshold cocaine doses (too small to cause reward or obvious behavioural change in naïve animals) can trigger conditioned place preference (CPP—a reward-seeking behaviour) after sensitization.

- **Early exposure increases later sensitivity.**  
  Adolescent cocaine exposure makes adult animals more sensitive to later low doses, activating more CaMKII-positive neurons and inducing “feel off” phenotypes such as reduced DUSP1, a stress-regulating factor.

- **Sensitization shifts dopamine signalling thresholds.**  
  Chronic cocaine can dampen baseline dopamine during intoxication but make the system more reactive to low doses over time. In both humans and animals, repeated use increases sensitivity to toxic effects (anxiety, paranoia) at lower doses than were initially required.

- **Hypersensitive models show dramatic changes after repetition.**  
  Low-PPI mouse models (used as a proxy for sensory/gating hypersensitivity) may show low initial sensitivity to cocaine but massive increases after repeated exposure.

- **Binding studies are calibrated for big doses, not traces.**  
  Dopamine transporter (DAT) occupancy studies typically examine mg-scale doses, with measurable effects starting at tens of milligrams. Yet sensitization studies show that sub-threshold doses in the 0.7–5 mg/kg range can elicit locomotion or reward after priming. We have essentially no nano/microgram-level data in sensitized humans.

Taken together, these findings suggest a consistent pattern:

- sensitization enhances sub-threshold activity in dopamine pathways  
- low doses can calm or normalize in some contexts and trigger anxiety in others, depending on prior history and state  
- stress and trauma increase sensitization to low-dose stimulants  

In other words: in wired, sensitized, or susceptible systems, the “wrong setting on the voltmeter” really does hide real signals. The absence of evidence at coarse resolution and in average populations is not evidence of absence for people whose nervous systems are running in milliamp mode.

## 6. Branding the Feeling: When the Market Message Matches the Mechanism

Coca-Cola has never really sold “a cola.” For decades, its advertising has focused not on ingredients, but on state:

- “It’s the real thing.”  
- “You can’t beat the feeling.”  
- “Taste the feeling.”  
- “Things go better with Coke.”

These are not descriptions of a flavour profile. They are direct appeals to how Coke makes you feel—positioning the drink as a reliable state-change tool. For most consumers, this is just clever branding. For susceptible individuals, it can feel uncomfortably literal.

If Coke and Diet Coke act as mild, legal micro-stimulants in a subset of people with highly reactive nervous systems, then the slogans are doing double duty:

- On the surface, they sell a lifestyle and an emotion.  
- At a deeper level, they resonate with the lived reality of people who really do experience Coke as something you “can’t beat the feeling” of, and who reach for it to make “things go better.”

From the inside of a susceptible nervous system, the brand message can feel less like advertising and more like recognition:

> “Here is the thing that fixes your state. Here is the thing you rely on.”

It is important to be precise:

- We do not have evidence that Coca-Cola is intentionally formulating for micro-stimulant effects in susceptible individuals or knowingly exploiting trace alkaloids in that way.

What we do have is an uncanny alignment between:

- a product that, for some people, functions as a subtle psychoactive, and  
- a decades-long marketing strategy built around feelings, performance, and life going “better with Coke.”

For a subset of susceptible brains, that combination can turn a branded beverage into a socially invisible dependence loop: the culture calls it “just soda,” the ads call it a feeling, and the nervous system quietly treats it as a drug. From their perspective, the advertising doesn’t just sell Coke—it almost feels like it’s winking at them about what it actually does.

## 7. Clinical Signal: How This Shows Up in Real Life

Clinically and anecdotally, a recognizable pattern keeps appearing around Coke and Diet Coke in susceptible individuals. These are not people who “just like soda.” They often report that:

- They can drink other sodas, coffee, or energy drinks without the same psychological fallout, and  
- Yet Coke or Diet Coke consistently “hit different”—in how they feel, how they crave, and how hard it is to stop.

Common features include:

- **Next-day anxiety or mood shifts** that correlate specifically with Coke/Diet Coke, not with other caffeine or sugar sources. People describe going from a relatively calm day (e.g., anxiety 2–3/10) to a sudden spike (8–10/10) the following day after what they considered “a small amount” of Coke.  

- **Heavy, entrenched use patterns**, such as drinking Coke or Diet Coke as the primary daily fluid (multiple cans or bottles per day) while barely touching water or other beverages, often maintained for years.  

- **Difficulty quitting that feels disproportionate** to “just a drink”: repeated failed attempts to cut down, strong pushback when abstinence is suggested, and a noticeable emotional reaction to the idea of stopping, even in people who freely admit it may be bad for their health or anxiety.  

- **Use as a performance or state-control tool**—to focus, to push through fatigue, to stabilize mood before tasks, or in athletic contexts where other equally caffeinated options are available but not perceived as equivalent.  

- **Substitution for prior stimulant or cocaine use**: Coke or Diet Coke becoming the “acceptable,” legal, socially invisible substitute once illegal drugs are stopped—while the relationship to the drink looks more like dependence than preference.  

- **Changes in subjective taste or body sensation** (e.g., suddenly finding Diet Coke “disgustingly sweet,” feeling tingling in the lips when chugging Coke, or describing it as “too intense”), yet continued consumption despite this aversion, which is more consistent with a dependency loop than simple hedonic enjoyment.

These patterns are not universal, and many people drink Coke or Diet Coke without any obvious problem. But in susceptible individuals—those with highly reactive nervous systems, anxiety/ADHD/trauma histories, or prior stimulant exposure—the combination of:

- specific brand craving  
- reproducible state changes  
- resistance to stopping despite insight  

looks less like a casual beverage habit and more like a mild, legal micro-stimulant relationship hiding in plain sight.

It is this subset, not the general population, that this paper is concerned with.
