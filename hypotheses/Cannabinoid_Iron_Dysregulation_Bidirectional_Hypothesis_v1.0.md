## A Bidirectional Mechanistic Framework Involving DMT1 and Hepcidin

**Document type:** Mechanistic framework with explicit falsifiers

Abstract

Iron homeostasis is governed by two primary regulatory axes: intestinal iron uptake mediated by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1) and systemic iron export regulated by the hepcidin–ferroportin pathway. Cannabinoid signaling—particularly via CB2 receptors—has been shown to interact with both axes, but with markedly asymmetric evidentiary support.

This framework synthesizes existing molecular, immunologic, and epidemiologic evidence into a bidirectional model in which cannabinoid exposure may plausibly lead to either increased iron availability or functional iron deficiency, depending on exposure pattern, inflammatory context, dietary iron composition, and host susceptibility. Importantly, the framework does not assume a single net direction of effect.

Explicit falsifiers, confounders, and testable predictions are stated to enable rapid constraint or refutation.

1. Scope and Framing

This document presents a mechanistically grounded framework, not a clinical recommendation or established theory.

Evidence is labeled throughout using the following convention:

(A) Evidence-backed: supported by direct experimental or clinical data

(B) Plausible mechanism: biologically coherent but not directly demonstrated in this context

(C) Speculative: logical extension requiring substantial validation

2. Iron Homeostasis: Core Regulatory Axes
2.1 DMT1-Mediated Non-Heme Iron Uptake (A)

DMT1 (SLC11A2) mediates uptake of non-heme iron at the intestinal brush border. Transport activity is regulated by phosphorylation state (notably Ser43), which determines iron translocation efficiency.

Experimental data demonstrate that CB2 receptor activation reduces DMT1 activity via altered phosphorylation, leading to decreased non-heme iron uptake (A).

Key implication: Non-heme iron absorption is directly suppressible by cannabinoid signaling.

2.2 Hepcidin-Ferroportin Axis (A → B)

Hepcidin is the master regulator of systemic iron distribution. Elevated hepcidin reduces ferroportin-mediated iron export from enterocytes and macrophages, producing iron sequestration and functional deficiency even when total iron stores are adequate (A).

Hepcidin expression is strongly upregulated by inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1). CB2 signaling has anti-inflammatory effects in immune cells (A), raising the plausible (but not proven) possibility of indirect hepcidin suppression under certain exposure conditions (B).

2.3 Heme Iron as a Bypass Pathway (A)

Heme iron absorption occurs via pathways independent of DMT1. While subsequent export still depends on ferroportin, heme intake bypasses the DMT1 “brake” entirely.

Critical variable: Dietary heme fraction strongly modulates net iron effects.

3. Cannabinoid Exposure Dynamics
3.1 Acute / Intermittent Exposure (A → B)

Short-term or intermittent cannabinoid exposure preserves CB2-linked signaling integrity and may reduce inflammatory tone (A), plausibly lowering hepcidin (B).

In this context:

DMT1 inhibition reduces non-heme uptake (A)

Heme iron remains unaffected

Net direction depends on diet and baseline inflammation

3.2 Chronic or Inhaled Exposure (A → B)

Chronic exposure—particularly via inhalation—introduces combustion-related pulmonary inflammation (A), which may elevate systemic inflammatory markers and hepcidin (B).

This framework does not require CB2 downregulation; it only requires reduced reliability or dominance of CB2-linked anti-inflammatory effects under sustained exposure.

3.3 Heavy Metal Confounding (A)

Cannabis plants can accumulate cadmium and lead. NHANES data show elevated heavy metal burden in exclusive cannabis users (A). Both metals independently disrupt iron metabolism.

Design requirement: Heavy metals must be measured or adjusted for any interpretable analysis.

4. The Net-Direction Paradox

Two competing mechanisms act in opposite directions:

Mechanism	Evidence	Direction
CB2 → ↓ DMT1 activity	A	↓ non-heme absorption
CB2 → ↓ inflammation → ↓ hepcidin	B	↑ iron export
Inhalation inflammation → ↑ hepcidin	A → B	↓ circulating iron

Conclusion: Net iron effects are context-dependent, not uniform.

5. Predicted Phenotypes
5.1 Pro-Availability Phenotype (B)

More likely when:

Intermittent exposure

Low baseline inflammation

High dietary heme iron

No physiologic iron loss (e.g., males)

Possible findings:

Elevated TSAT

Elevated serum iron

Iron accumulation in susceptible hosts

5.2 Functional Deficiency Phenotype (B)

More likely when:

Chronic or inhaled exposure

Elevated inflammatory markers

Low heme intake

Heavy metal burden present

Possible findings:

Low TSAT

Normal or high ferritin

Fatigue, cognitive impairment

Poor response to iron supplementation

6. Observational Evidence: NHANES Constraints

NHANES-based studies report:

Higher hemoglobin in current marijuana users (p ≈ 0.02) (A)

Altered RBC indices without reported iron panels (A)

Importantly, serum iron was used as a covariate, not an outcome, preventing directional inference.

Limitation: Full-text iron panel results from PheWAS analyses were unavailable at the time of drafting.

7. Sex-Specific Modifiers

Men: No physiologic iron loss → higher accumulation risk (B)

Premenopausal women: Menstrual loss + estrogen-mediated hepcidin suppression buffer accumulation (A)

Postmenopausal women: Risk profile shifts toward male pattern (B)

8. Explicit Falsifiers

This framework would be constrained or refuted if:

Controlled studies show no association between cannabinoid exposure and hepcidin or inflammatory markers after adjusting for smoking and metals

DMT1 inhibition is not observed in vivo under acute exposure

Iron indices show no stratification by exposure pattern, diet, or inflammation

9. What This Framework Is Not

Not a clinical guideline

Not a claim of harm or benefit

Not a population-average effect

It is a structured map of competing mechanisms designed to be tested, narrowed, or disproven.

10. Summary

Cannabinoid exposure plausibly interacts with iron regulation through two opposing pathways. Treating cannabis–iron interactions as unidirectional obscures real risk heterogeneity. This framework makes that ambiguity explicit, testable, and falsifiable.
