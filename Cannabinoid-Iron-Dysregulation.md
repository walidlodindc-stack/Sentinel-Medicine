## Abstract

Iron homeostasis is governed primarily by two regulatory axes: intestinal iron uptake mediated by divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1), and systemic iron distribution regulated by the hepcidin–ferroportin axis. Emerging evidence suggests that cannabinoid signaling—particularly via CB2 receptors—interacts with both axes through immunomodulatory and inflammatory pathways. However, these interactions appear context-dependent and directionally asymmetric.

This paper presents a mechanistically grounded framework in which cannabinoid exposure can plausibly contribute to either iron deficiency or iron sequestration phenotypes depending on exposure pattern, inflammatory context, and baseline iron status. The framework is explicitly falsifiable, distinguishes evidence strength across mechanisms, and identifies confounders and experimental designs capable of refuting or refining the model.

## 1. Background: Core Iron Regulatory Axes

### 1.1 Intestinal Iron Uptake (DMT1)

DMT1 mediates non-heme iron uptake across the apical membrane of enterocytes. Its expression is regulated by intracellular iron levels, hypoxia-inducible factors, and inflammatory signaling. Upregulation increases iron absorption; downregulation limits systemic iron entry.

### 1.2 Systemic Iron Distribution (Hepcidin)

Hepcidin, synthesized primarily in the liver, controls iron efflux by inducing degradation of ferroportin. Elevated hepcidin results in iron sequestration within macrophages and enterocytes, producing functional iron deficiency even when total body iron stores are normal or elevated.

## 2. Cannabinoid Signaling Relevant to Iron Homeostasis

### 2.1 CB2 Receptors and Immune Modulation (Evidence level: A)

CB2 receptors are expressed on immune cells and regulate cytokine production, macrophage polarization, and inflammatory tone. Multiple studies demonstrate CB2-mediated suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines under certain conditions.

### 2.2 Interaction With Hepcidin Regulation (Evidence level: B)

Hepcidin expression is sensitive to inflammatory mediators such as IL-6. By modulating immune signaling, cannabinoids may indirectly influence hepcidin synthesis. Directionality likely depends on acute vs chronic exposure and baseline inflammatory state.

### 2.3 DMT1 Regulation via Inflammatory Pathways (Evidence level: B)

Inflammation alters DMT1 expression through NF-κB and hypoxia-related signaling. Cannabinoid-driven immune modulation provides a plausible but not yet directly established pathway for altered DMT1 activity.

## 3. Bidirectional Dysregulation Model

### 3.1 Pathway A: Functional Iron Deficiency via Hepcidin Elevation

**Context:** Chronic exposure, inflammatory or immune-activated baseline  

1. Cannabinoid signaling alters immune cytokine balance  
2. IL-6–mediated hepcidin upregulation persists  
3. Ferroportin degradation increases  
4. Serum iron and transferrin saturation decline despite adequate stores  

**Predicted phenotype:**  
- Low serum iron  
- Normal or elevated ferritin  
- Reduced iron responsiveness to oral supplementation  

(Evidence strength: B)

### 3.2 Pathway B: Iron Depletion via Reduced Absorption

**Context:** Intermittent exposure, low inflammatory tone  

1. Cannabinoid signaling suppresses inflammatory tone  
2. Downregulation of DMT1 expression or activity  
3. Reduced intestinal iron uptake  
4. Progressive iron deficiency over time  

**Predicted phenotype:**  
- Low serum iron  
- Low ferritin  
- Preserved response to supplementation  

(Evidence strength: B)

## 4. Asymmetry and Context Dependence

The two pathways are not mutually exclusive and may alternate within individuals depending on:

- Exposure pattern (acute vs chronic)
- Cannabinoid formulation and dose
- Baseline immune activation
- Dietary iron composition
- Genetic variation in iron regulation

This asymmetry explains heterogeneous clinical observations without requiring uniform effects.

---

## 5. Confounders and Competing Explanations

Key confounders that must be controlled before attribution:

- Dietary iron intake and bioavailability  
- Gastrointestinal pathology  
- Menstrual or occult blood loss  
- Heavy metal exposure (lead, cadmium)  
- Alcohol use and liver function  

Failure to control for these invalidates causal inference.

---

## 6. Explicit Falsifiers

The framework would be falsified if:

1. Chronic cannabinoid exposure shows no association with hepcidin levels after inflammatory control  
2. DMT1 expression remains unchanged across exposure conditions in controlled models  
3. Iron phenotypes do not differ from matched non-exposed controls under identical diets  

---

## 7. Testable Predictions

1. Differential ferritin–iron discordance between chronic and intermittent exposure cohorts  
2. Exposure-pattern–specific shifts in hepcidin independent of CRP  
3. Reversibility of iron phenotype following exposure cessation  

---

## 8. Proposed Study Designs

- Longitudinal observational studies stratified by exposure pattern  
- Controlled animal models with inflammatory manipulation  
- Human crossover studies with stable dietary iron intake  

---

## 9. Limitations

This framework synthesizes indirect mechanistic evidence and epidemiologic signals. Direct causal pathways remain incompletely characterized. Full-text extraction of detailed association tables from large PheWAS studies would materially strengthen constraint or refutation of the model.

---

## 10. Conclusion

Cannabinoid–iron interactions are unlikely to be unidirectional or uniform. A bidirectional, context-dependent model better accounts for observed variability and generates falsifiable predictions. This framework is intended to constrain hypotheses, not to guide clinical decision-making.
