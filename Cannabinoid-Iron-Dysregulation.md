## Abstract

Iron homeostasis is regulated by two principal mechanisms at the intestinal and systemic level: hepcidin-mediated control of ferroportin (governing iron export from enterocytes, macrophages, and hepatocytes) and DMT1-mediated uptake of non-heme iron in the duodenum. Cannabinoid receptor type-2 (CB2) signaling interfaces with both pathways—but the evidentiary weight is asymmetric: CB2-linked inhibition of DMT1 reduces non-heme iron uptake (A), whereas potential CB2-mediated reductions in inflammatory/hepcidin signaling are inferred but unproven in typical human exposure contexts (B). Net directionality is therefore unresolved and context-dependent.

We propose that the direction of iron dysregulation depends on exposure pattern, route of administration, baseline inflammatory tone, and dietary heme fraction (which bypasses DMT1). Intermittent exposure with preserved CB2-linked signaling, high dietary heme iron, and low inflammatory tone may produce net pro-availability and possible accumulation in susceptible individuals (B). Chronic exposure—especially inhaled—may shift toward inflammation-driven hepcidin elevation, iron sequestration, and functional iron deficiency (B). Sex-specific physiology (menstrual iron loss and estrogen-mediated hepcidin suppression) modifies clinical expression across these scenarios.

This framework is mechanistically grounded, explicitly falsifiable, and generates testable predictions. Full-text extraction of iron panel results from key NHANES-based studies is required to constrain or refute it.

## 1. Introduction

Iron is essential for oxygen transport, mitochondrial metabolism, and neurotransmitter synthesis. Dysregulation—manifesting as either overload or functional deficiency—is common and frequently misclassified. While hereditary hemochromatosis explains some iron accumulation, many individuals present with unexplained overload or refractory deficiency without a clear etiology (A).

Cannabis use is widespread, yet hematologic and metabolic consequences remain underexplored. Many commonly reported symptoms (fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, cognitive “fog”) overlap with iron dysregulation phenotypes. Most epidemiologic studies treat cannabis exposure as binary (use vs non-use), ignoring exposure pattern, route, recovery interval, diet composition, and confounders (notably heavy metal burden).

This paper proposes a bidirectional mechanism: one arm reduces non-heme uptake via DMT1 (A), while another arm may reduce hepcidin via reduced inflammatory signaling (B). The interaction produces a “net direction” ambiguity that is biologically plausible and empirically testable.

## 2. Iron Homeostasis: Hepcidin, DMT1, and Heme Iron

### 2.1 The Hepcidin Axis

Hepcidin is the master regulator of systemic iron balance. Produced primarily by the liver, it binds ferroportin (the only known cellular iron exporter), inducing internalization and degradation. Elevated hepcidin reduces intestinal iron export, traps iron within macrophages and hepatocytes, and produces functional iron deficiency even when total body iron stores are adequate (A).

Hepcidin synthesis is upregulated by iron load, infection, and inflammatory cytokines—especially IL-6 and IL-1. IL-6 induces hepcidin through STAT3 signaling (A). IL-1 also induces hepcidin transcription through partially distinct pathways and can be a strong inducer in hepatocyte models (A).

Hepcidin is downregulated by iron deficiency, hypoxia, and increased erythropoietic demand. Erythropoietin-driven erythropoiesis suppresses hepcidin via erythroferrone (ERFE), which matters when interpreting hemoglobin-linked observational findings (Section 6).

### 2.2 DMT1 and Non-Heme Iron Uptake

Divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1, SLC11A2) mediates uptake of non-heme ionic iron across duodenal enterocytes. DMT1 activity is regulated by serine phosphorylation at position 43: phosphorylation activates transport; dephosphorylation inactivates it (A).

Cannabinoids have been shown to inhibit DMT1-mediated iron uptake through CB2 signaling, reducing Ser43 phosphorylation and blocking transport activity (A). This is a direct mechanism for reduced non-heme iron absorption.

---

### 2.3 Heme Iron: A Parallel Absorption Pathway

Heme iron is absorbed via mechanisms distinct from DMT1 (A). While the specific transporter remains unresolved, functional independence of heme uptake from DMT1 is established. Once inside enterocytes, iron export still depends on ferroportin, which is regulated by hepcidin.

**Implication:** Dietary heme fraction is a critical variable because heme bypasses the DMT1 “brake” entirely, while hepcidin/ferroportin still governs export.

## 3. Cannabinoid–Immune Signaling and Exposure Dynamics

### 3.1 CB2 Distribution and Acute Effects (epistemically separated)

**Direct evidence (A):** CB2 receptors are expressed predominantly on immune cells (macrophages, NK cells, B cells, monocytes, T cells). Across many controlled models, CB2 activation can reduce pro-inflammatory cytokine output and dampen immune activation.

**Downstream inference (B):** Whether typical cannabinoid exposure patterns in humans reduce IL-6 or IL-1 sufficiently to produce meaningful hepatic hepcidin suppression—across routes, doses, and time—remains unproven. Therefore, the hepcidin arm is modeled as plausible (B), not established (A).

---

### 3.2 Sustained Exposure and Inhalation-Associated Inflammation

With sustained exposure, CB2-linked anti-inflammatory signaling may become less reliable or less consistently expressed across time (B). This framework does not require CB2 downregulation as a necessary step; it only posits that sustained exposure can reduce the predictability of CB2-linked anti-inflammatory effects relative to intermittent exposure (B).

Independently, inhalation introduces combustion byproducts that provoke pulmonary epithelial inflammation (A) and may increase systemic inflammatory burden via cytokine spillover (B). These dynamics make exposure pattern and route central variables.

---

### 3.3 Confounders: Heavy Metals

Cannabis plants can accumulate metals. NHANES analyses report elevated blood cadmium and lead in exclusive marijuana users compared to non-users (A). Because cadmium and lead affect erythropoiesis and iron metabolism, heavy metal burden should be measured and adjusted in studies evaluating cannabis–iron relationships to support interpretable inference.

## 4. Competing Mechanisms and the Net-Direction Paradox

This framework proposes two mechanisms pushing iron balance in opposing directions.

**Table 1. Mechanisms, Evidence Weight, Directionality, and Likely Dominance Conditions**

| Component | Mechanism | Evidence | Directional effect | More likely to dominate when… |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| DMT1 arm | CB2 → ↓ DMT1 Ser43 phosphorylation → ↓ non-heme uptake | (A) | ↓ absorption | High non-heme diet; intermittent exposure |
| Hepcidin arm | CB2-linked anti-inflammatory signaling → ↓ IL-6/IL-1 → ↓ hepcidin | (B) | ↑ mobilization | Low inflammation; high heme intake |
| Inhalation modifier | Combustion → inflammation → ↑ hepcidin | (A→B) | Sequestration | Chronic inhaled exposure |

**Net prediction:** Iron balance can shift toward accumulation or deficiency depending on diet, inflammation, route, and exposure pattern.

## 5. Hypothesis: Exposure-Pattern-Dependent Bidirectional Iron Dysregulation

### 5.1 Intermittent + High Heme + Low Inflammation → Net Pro-Availability Possible (B)

Intermittent exposure with preserved CB2 responsiveness may reduce inflammatory signaling, plausibly lowering hepcidin (B). DMT1 inhibition reduces non-heme uptake (A), but heme bypasses DMT1; therefore, high heme intake may tilt net direction toward increased availability (B).

**Predicted phenotype:** Elevated serum iron indices and/or transferrin saturation in susceptible individuals without regular iron loss (B).

---

### 5.2 Chronic/Inhaled + High Inflammation → Net Sequestration Likely (B)

Chronic exposure—especially inhaled—may increase inflammatory tone, elevating hepcidin (B). Elevated hepcidin reduces ferroportin activity, sequestering iron and producing functional iron deficiency.

**Predicted phenotype:** Low TSAT with normal or elevated ferritin, fatigue, cognitive impairment, and poor response to supplementation (B).

## 6. Engagement with NHANES-Based Observational Studies

### 6.1 Zhang et al. (2024; 2025)

Zhang et al. (2024) reported higher hemoglobin among current marijuana users (adjusted +0.111 g/dL; p = 0.02) but did **not** analyze iron indices as outcomes. Serum iron was included only as a sensitivity covariate.

Zhang et al. (2025) (PheWAS) reported multiple hematologic differences but did not report iron panel indices in the abstract.

### 6.2 Required Constraint

Full-text extraction of iron panel variables from both studies is required to constrain or refute this framework.

### 6.3 Interpretive Scenarios

1. Iron indices positive → supports pro-availability arm  
2. Null/inverse → constrains model  
3. Excluded → rationale informative  
4. Multiple-comparison suppression (C) → direction unresolved  

---

## 7. Sex-Specific Predictions

### Men
- No physiologic iron loss  
- Higher accumulation risk under intermittent/high-heme conditions (B)  
- Functional deficiency possible with chronic exposure (B)

### Premenopausal Women
- Menstrual loss buffers accumulation (A)  
- Estrogen suppresses hepcidin (A)  
- Deficiency phenotypes may be more symptomatic (B)

### Postmenopausal Women
- Risk profile shifts toward male pattern (B)

## 8. Testable Predictions

1. Frequency-stratified NHANES re-analysis  
2. Full-text iron panel extraction  
3. Non-heme isotope tracer studies  
4. Hepcidin and cytokine measurement  
5. Diet–exposure interaction effects  
6. Sex-stratified phenotype separation  
7. Cessation-response studies  

**Explicit falsifier:** No association between exposure pattern and hepcidin or IL-6/IL-1 after adjustment refutes the hepcidin arm.

---

## 9. Limitations

The DMT1 arm is strong (A); the hepcidin arm remains inferential (B). Effect sizes may be modest. Hepcidin is rarely measured. Confounding must be rigorously controlled.

---

## 10. Discussion

This framework rejects binary exposure models and specifies why directionality should vary. It identifies missing competing mechanisms and generates falsifiable predictions rather than claims.

## Figure 1. Net Direction Decision Tree (text schematic)

**Step 1:** Route / inflammation  
- Chronic inhaled + inflammation → sequestration  
- Low inflammation → Step 2  

**Step 2:** Exposure pattern  
- Chronic → hepcidin dominant  
- Intermittent → Step 3  

**Step 3:** Diet  
- High heme → pro-availability possible  
- High non-heme → reduced absorption more likely  

Always adjust for metals, smoking, inflammation, and diet.

## Appendix A: Supporting Case (hedged)

A male patient of Central/South Asian ancestry developed cognitive impairment and exercise intolerance during a period of changing exposures. Laboratory testing showed elevated iron indices and high transferrin saturation; MRI confirmed hepatic and cardiac iron deposition. HFE testing was negative. Iron reduction therapy resolved symptoms.

A temporal association with intermittent inhaled cannabis exposure and high dietary heme intake was observed but remains correlational. This case is included for plausibility only.
